# Inventory-Management-WebApp
This is a simple inventory management website created using Python Flask as middleware, MySQL for the back-end, and HTML, CSS, and Tailwind for the front-end. The website consists of three pages: Home, Manage Inventory, and Login. The Manage Inventory page allows users to update or fill the book inventory through the website and view it on the dashboard.
